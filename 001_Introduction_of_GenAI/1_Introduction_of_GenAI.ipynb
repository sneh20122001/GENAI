They are called \"large\" because they are trained on massive amounts of text data, often billions of words, which allows them to learn the patterns and structures of language in a very comprehensive way.\n","\n","\n","###How they work:\n","\n","  - Deep Learning: LLMs are based on deep learning, a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with many layers to analyze data. These networks can learn complex patterns in the data, such as the relationships between words in a sentence.\n","  - Transformer Architecture: Many LLMs use a specific type of neural network architecture called a \"transformer.\" Transformers are particularly good at processing sequential data like text, as they can consider the context of words in a sentence to understand their meaning.\n","  - Training: LLMs are trained on massive datasets of text, which can include books, articles, websites, and code. During training, the model learns to predict the next word in a sentence, which helps it to understand the structure and grammar of language.\n","\n","\n","###What they can do ?\n","\n","1.

Deep Learning and Transformer Architecture\n","3. Scale\n","4. Self-Supervised Learning\n","5. Emergent Abilities\n","\n","\n","\n","####In simpler terms:\n","\n","Imagine a child learning to speak. A child who is exposed to a lot of language, reads many books, and has a good teacher will become a more fluent and knowledgeable speaker. LLMs are similar â€“ they are exposed to massive amounts of text data, have a powerful \"brain\" (the transformer architecture), and are constantly learning and improving. This combination of factors makes them incredibly powerful language models.\n","\n","\n","###Limitations of LLMs:\n","\n","- Bias: LLMs can inherit biases from the data they are trained on, which can lead to them generating biased or unfair text.\n","- Hallucinations: LLMs can sometimes generate text that is factually incorrect or nonsensical.\n","- Computational cost: Training and running LLMs can be very computationally expensive.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"WrLWjFX6F74X"}}]}
