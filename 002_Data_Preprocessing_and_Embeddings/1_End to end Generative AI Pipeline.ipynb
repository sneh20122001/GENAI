Data Acquisition\n","\n","\n","###1.1 Data Sources:\n","\n","- Available Data (Structured & Unstructured):\n"," - CSV, Text, PDF, DOC, Excel: These are common formats. Think of text files of song lyrics or CSV files containing customer reviews.\n","    - Example: A .csv file with product descriptions and corresponding customer ratings. A .txt file containing the complete works of Shakespeare.\n","  - Databases (SQL, NoSQL): Structured data in databases can be queried. Imagine a database of medical records or financial transactions.\n","    - Example: A SQL database containing user profiles and their purchase history. A NoSQL database storing sensor readings from IoT devices.\n","- Other Data Sources:\n","  - Internet (Web Scraping): Gathering data from websites. Be mindful of terms of service and robots.txt.\n","    - Example: Scraping reviews from e-commerce sites. Extracting articles from news websites.\n","  - APIs: Accessing data from services like Twitter, Spotify, or weather APIs. This requires authentication.\n","    - Example: Using the Twitter API to collect tweets related to a specific hashtag. Accessing image data from a stock photo API.\n","  - Sensor Data (IoT): Data from connected devices. Think of temperature readings or GPS coordinates.\n","    - Example: Time series data from a smart thermostat. Location data from a fleet of delivery vehicles.\n","- No Data (Synthetic Data Generation):\n","  - Creating Own Data: Manually creating data, which can be time-consuming. Good for very specific or niche datasets.\n","    - Example: Labeling images for object detection. Transcribing audio recordings.\n","  - LLM-Generated Data: Using Large Language Models to create synthetic data. Useful for prototyping or augmenting small datasets.\n","    - Example: Generating text descriptions of fictional products. Creating code snippets in a specific programming language.\n","\n","###1.2 Data Augmentation (Addressing Data Scarcity):\n","\n","When you have limited data, augmentation techniques can artificially increase your dataset size, leading to better model generalization.  This is crucial for preventing overfitting.\n","\n","- Synonym Replacement: Replacing words with their synonyms. \"The cat sat on the mat\" becomes \"The feline sat upon the rug.\"\n","- Bigram Flipping: Swapping the order of adjacent words. \"The cat sat\" becomes \"cat the sat.\" This is more effective for longer sequences.\n","- Back Translation: Translating text to another language and then back to the original. This introduces slight variations. \"The cat sat on the mat\" -> \"Le chat Ã©tait assis sur le tapis\" -> \"The cat was sitting on the mat.\"\n","- Adding Noise: Introducing small, controlled distortions. For images, this could be adding slight Gaussian noise. For text, it might involve typos or random insertions.\n","- Data Combination: Combining existing datasets or augmenting them with external data. For example, combining two similar image datasets."],"metadata":{"id":"I37_N8XzUAhT"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##2. Data Preprocessing\n","\n","###2.1 Data Cleanup:\n","\n","- Handling Missing Values: Decide how to deal with missing data (imputation, removal). Leaving missing values can confuse the model.\n","    - Example: Replacing missing age values with the average age. Removing rows with too many missing values.\n","- Noise Removal: Removing irrelevant or corrupt data points. This could be fixing typos in text or removing artifacts in images.\n","    - Example: Correcting misspelled words in a text corpus. Removing scratches from scanned documents.\n","- Duplicate Removal: Eliminating redundant data entries. Duplicates can skew the model's learning.\n","    - Example: Removing identical product descriptions. Deleting duplicate customer reviews.\n","\n","###2.2 Basic Preprocessing:\n","\n","- Tokenization: Breaking down text into individual units (tokens). This can be at the sentence or word level.\n","    - Example: Sentence tokenization: \"The cat sat on the mat. The dog barked.\" becomes [\"The cat sat on the mat.\", \"The dog barked.\"]. Word tokenization: \"The cat sat\" becomes [\"The\", \"cat\", \"sat\"].\n","- Text Normalization: Standardizing text format (e.g., handling different character encodings). Ensures consistency in the data.\n","    - Example: Converting all text to UTF-8 encoding. Handling different representations of accented characters.\n","\n","\n","###2.3 Optional Preprocessing (Often Beneficial):\n","\n","- Stop Word Removal: Removing common words that don't carry much meaning (e.g., \"the,\" \"a,\" \"is\"). Reduces noise and improves efficiency.\n","    - Example: Removing \"the\" and \"a\" from the sentence \"The cat sat on a mat.\"\n","- Stemming: Reducing words to their root form (e.g., \"running\" to \"run\"). Simplifies the vocabulary.\n","    - Example: \"running,\" \"runs,\" and \"ran\" are all reduced to \"run.\"\n","- Lemmatization: Similar to stemming but uses a dictionary to find the base form (lemma) of a word. More accurate than stemming.\n","    - Example: \"running\" becomes \"run,\" while \"better\" becomes \"good.\"\n","- Punctuation Removal: Removing punctuation marks. Often necessary for text-based tasks.\n","    - Example: \"Hello, world!\" becomes \"Hello world.\"\n","- Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase. Treats \"The\" and \"the\" as the same word.\n","    - Example: \"The Cat Sat\" becomes \"the cat sat.\"\n","- Language Detection: Identifying the language of the text. Useful for multilingual datasets.\n","    - Example: Identifying \"Bonjour le monde\" as French.\n","\n","###2.4 Advanced Preprocessing (For More Complex Tasks):\n","\n","- Part-of-Speech Tagging: Identifying the grammatical role of each word (e.g., noun, verb, adjective). Useful for tasks like natural language understanding.\n","    - Example: \"The cat sat\" becomes \"The (DET) cat (NOUN) sat (VERB).\"\n","- Parsing: Analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences. Provides a deeper understanding of the text.\n","    - Example: Creating a parse tree for the sentence \"The cat sat on the mat.\"\n","- Coreference Resolution: Identifying which words or phrases refer to the same entity. Important for understanding context.\n","    - Example: In the sentence \"John went to the store. He bought a book,\" coreference resolution identifies that \"He\" refers to \"John.\""],"metadata":{"id":"AT72zL_OUAc5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##3. Feature Engineering\n","\n","###3.1 Text Vectorization: Representing Text Numerically\n","\n","- Text vectorization is the process of converting text into numerical vectors.  These vectors capture the semantic meaning and statistical properties of the text, enabling machine learning models to process and understand textual information.\n","\n","- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Measures the importance of a word within a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). Words that appear frequently in a specific document but rarely in others have high TF-IDF scores.\n","    - Example: In a corpus of news articles, the word \"election\" would likely have a high TF-IDF score in articles about elections. TF-IDF helps identify keywords.\n","- Bag of Words (BoW): Represents text as a \"bag\" of its words, disregarding grammar and word order. Counts the frequency of each word in the text.\n","    - Example: \"The cat sat on the mat\" and \"The mat sat on the cat\" have the same BoW representation. BoW is simple but loses word order information.\n","- Word2Vec: A neural network-based technique that learns to represent words as dense, continuous vectors. Words with similar meanings have vectors that are close together in vector space.\n","    - Example: The vectors for \"king\" and \"queen\" would be closer than the vectors for \"king\" and \"cat.\" Word2Vec captures semantic relationships.\n","- One-Hot Encoding: Creates a binary vector for each word, where only the element corresponding to that word is set to 1, and all other elements are 0. Useful for representing categorical variables.\n","    - Example: If \"cat\" is the third word in the vocabulary, its one-hot vector would be [0, 0, 1, 0, ...]. One-hot encoding is simple but can lead to very large vectors.\n","- Transformer Models (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.): Powerful deep learning models that generate contextualized word embeddings. These embeddings capture the meaning of a word in its specific context.\n","    - Example: The word \"bank\" would have different embeddings in the sentences \"I went to the bank\" and \"The river bank was beautiful.\" Transformers are state-of-the-art for many NLP tasks.\n","\n","\n","###3.2 Other Feature Engineering Techniques for Text:\n","\n","- N-grams: Sequences of n consecutive words. Capture some word order information. For example, \"the cat sat\" is a 3-gram.\n","- Character N-grams: Sequences of n characters. Useful for handling misspellings and out-of-vocabulary words.\n","- Syntactic Features: Features derived from the grammatical structure of sentences (e.g., part-of-speech tags, parse trees).\n","- Sentiment Features: Features that capture the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in the text.\n","- Topic Modeling: Techniques like LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to discover topics within a collection of documents.\n","\n","###3.3 Feature Engineering for Other Data Types:\n","\n","While text data is a common area for feature engineering, the principles apply to other data types as well:\n","\n","- Images: Extracting features like edges, corners, textures, or using pre-trained convolutional neural networks to generate feature vectors.\n","- Audio: Extracting features like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) or spectrograms.\n","- Time Series: Extracting features like trends, seasonality, or statistical measures."],"metadata":{"id":"LV484AJFUAcl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##4.
